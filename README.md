# wsi-checker

Utility for running WS-I.org Basic Profile 1.1 validation tool

## Build/test

### Tool to analyze wsdl

* To build stand alone jar: mvn package
* Run: java -jar target/wsi-checker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -config file  [-summary file]

Examples:

* java -jar target/wsi-checker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -config target/config.xml
* java -jar target/wsi-checker-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -config target/config.xml -summary target/summary.json


### Tool to generate wsi configuration file

* To build stand alone jar: mvn -Pconfig package
* Run: java -jar target/config-generator.jar -wsdl file -report file -output file
* Run: java -jar target/config-generator.jar -wsdl file -report file -output file -binding index

Example: java -jar target/config-generator.jar -wsdl src/test/resources/wsdl/wsdl_1.wsdl -report target/report.xml
 -output target/config.xml

Default is to use the first binding in the wsdl. If the wsdl has more than one binding, add the -binding option to
generate config file for a specific binding.

### WS-I

The WS-I folder contains the ws-i.org basic profile libraries, profiles schemas etc. The java/lib folder has
been cleaned up to just contain the libraries (wsi-test-tools.jar, wsdl4j.jar, uddi4j.jar) and xerces has been
moved to the pom. These are the jar files that this project need for the WSDL validation being performed. Other
validations may need more of the libraries from the standard tool distribution.
