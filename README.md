### WS-I

The WS-I folder contains the ws-i.org basic profile libraries, profiles schemas etc. The java/lib folder has
been cleaned up to just contain the libraries (wsi-test-tools.jar, wsdl4j.jar, uddi4j.jar) and xerces has been
moved to the pom. These are the jar files that this project need for the WSDL validation being performed. Other
validations may need more of the libraries from the standard tool distribution.
